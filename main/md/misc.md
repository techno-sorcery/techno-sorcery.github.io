### Playlists
[Classic Classical](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4gjIatZfsFxEhlnaih5mU2?si=e94790f8317d4875)  
The best of classical music (and a tad bit of ragtime). All I listened to in 10th grade.


[Prog Rock](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6owsn3ut8DC8nYuxFO4fcz?si=10b3392ab8314bd4)

[Cassette Rock](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1moiOwMjvqgH6dKJ93Bi7G?si=2cfda481c78a4e10)  
Rock music from the 70s and 80s. You could probably find it on cassette, maybe even 8-track.
