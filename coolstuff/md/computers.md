### Current computers  
**ThinkPad P51 (laptop)**   
*Date: 2023 - Present  
CPU: i7 7820HQ @ 3.5 GHz (4C, 8T)  
GPU: Intel HD 630, Quadro M1200 4GB  
RAM: 32GB DDR4  
Storage: 500GB NVME, 500GB SSD  
OS: Debian 12*  

It was purchased at an electronics swap meet for the mere price of $50. I had no intent on replacing my T530, but I couldn't pass it up. Whereas my other laptops have only been good for 90% of my computing needs, I can confidently say this one covers all of them. Obviously it isn't as powerful as my desktop, but it's still more than good enough. It's a heavy workstation laptop but, unlike the T530, it has better battery life, a sleeker design, and much better specs. Save for the (already pretty good) processor, it's equally as expandable as any of the "classic" models.<br><br>

**Lightbox (desktop)**  
*Date: 2018 - Present  
CPU: i7 8700k @ 4.8 GHz (6C, 12T)  
GPU: GTX 1060 6GB  
RAM: 32GB DDR4  
Storage: 500GB NVME, 4TB HDD  
OS: Windows 10 (Sadly)*  

I acquired most of the pieces as part of a middle school culmination present, though I reused the GPU and PSU from my previous build. It served as my primary machine up until late 2022, when it was effectively replaced with a more convenient ThinkPad. Still extremely powerful, even five years after being built. In 2022, I replaced the case, and original 1TB WD Black with a 4TB WD Red.<br><br>

### Past computers
**ThinkPad T530 (laptop)**  
*Date: 2022 - 2023  
CPU: i7 3620MQ @ 3.3 GHz (4C, 8T)  
GPU: Intel HD 4000  
RAM: 16GB DDR3  
Storage: 256GB SSD  
OS: Debian 11*  

This one was a real pleasure to use. It was bought at the same swap meet I got my P51 from for only $20. Over the next few months, I slowly upgraded it to a 1080p display, quad-core processor, and classic-style keyboard. Even though it wasn't as powerful as a modern laptop, the T530 did most non-3D tasks just fine. My only issues were the horrible battery life, and performance under a single application (Vivado). It has since been given to my dad, with the intent of replacing his 2008 MacBook Pro.<br><br>

**ThinkPad X230 (laptop)**  
*Date: 2022 - 2022  
CPU: i5-3230M @ 3.2 GHz (2C, 4T)  
GPU: Intel HD 4000  
RAM: 8GB DDR3  
Storage: 500GB SSD  
OS: Debian 11*  

Man, I miss this laptop. It was my first "classic" ThinkPad, purchased as an X220i from the swap meet for $15, and upgraded to an X230 over the next couple months. The form factor, battery life, and design were great. It was also the machine that got me into Linux, and led me to settle on Debian.Unfortunately, it was stolen after I left my bag at a table, and never seen it again. Oh well.<br><br>

**Voyager 2 (desktop)**  
*Date: 2016 - 2018  
CPU: i5-4690 @ 3.9 GHz (4C, 4T)  
GPU: GTX 1060 6GB  
RAM: 16GB DDR3  
Storage: 256GB SSD, 1TB HDD  
OS: Windows 10*  

It's not really clear when Voyager 1 became Voyager 2, but I suppose the best answer is when I upgraded the power supply and graphics card. I don't much to say about this build, other than that it worked pretty well. Played all my games just fine; only reason I upgraded it was so I could play BeamNG with more NPC cars. I took the GPU and PSU out for Lightbox, and gave it to my dad.<br><br> 

**Voyager 1 (desktop)**  
*Date: 2015 - 2016  
CPU: i5-4690 @ 3.9 GHz (4C, 4T)  
GPU: GTX 750 TI  
RAM: 16GB DDR3  
Storage: 120GB SSD, 1TB HDD  
OS: Windows 10*  

This was my first gaming PC, built over a 4-month period when 12 year-old me got sick of trying to game on my MacBook. The processor and motherboard were purchased in a set à la a Frys deal (RIP), as were the hard drive and the RAM. I originally used a swap meet Dell Dimension 2000 case, though eventually upgraded it to one from Corsair. For the first few months, I used the on-board Intel HD 4600 iGPU. However, with the release of Fallout 4, I upgraded to a GTX 750 TI.<br><br>

**MacBook Pro, 2012 (laptop)**  
*Date: 2012 - 2022  
CPU i5-3210M @ 3.1 GHz (2C, 4T)  
GPU: Intel HD 4000  
RAM: 16GB DDR3  
Storage: 256GB SSD  
OS: Mac OS Big Sur*  

I was gifted this MacBook Pro for my 9th birthday, after asking to finally have my own computer. It originally came with 4GB of RAM, and a 500 GB HDD. It was my main computer up until 2015, when I primarily replaced it with Voyager 1. However, I continued to use it at school and on trips until early 2022. At some point, I upgraded the RAM to 16GB, and the HDD to an SSD. Other than having an abysmal cooling system, it was a fairly decent laptop. I decommissioned it when it started having WiFi issues, which didn't go away when I replaced the card.<br><br>
