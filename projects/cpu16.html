<p><strong>Architecture</strong></p>
<p><img alt="CPU-16 architecture flowchart" src="/projects/img/cpu16_arch.png" /></p>
<p>The CPU-16 uses a Von Neumann architecture, with a single address space containing both instructions and data.</p>
<p>There are eight general-purpose registers, D0-D7. Any combination can be selected as operands within the instruction word. However, D7 is implicitly used for stack operations. As with most other architectures, the stack grows down. Separately, there's a condition register (processor status/flags), and 16-bit program counter.</p>
<p>The ALU uses four 74181s. Additional circuitry provides byte swap, right bit-shift, and sign-extend functionality. Four flags— negative, zero, carry, overflow— are set every ALU operation  and used by conditional jumps.</p>
<p>Support is included for seven maskable interrupts, peripheral direct memory access, and (in the future) fault handling.</p>
<p>To prevent clock skew, a two-phase clock is used. Microcode is buffered on the first phase, and all other synchronous chips are clocked on the second.</p>
<p>A maximum of 64k words can be addressed at once, through the 16-bit address bus. However, this could be extended further with the implementation of a paging unit.<br><br></p>
<p><strong>Instruction set</strong></p>
<p><img alt="CPU-16 instruction list" src="/projects/img/cpu16_isa.png" /></p>
<p>The CPU-16 instruction set is orthogonal by design, allowing the programmer to use any set of addressing modes with (most) instructions. Supported modes include:  </p>
<ul>
<li>[reg] - Register</li>
<li>$m - Address, direct</li>
<li>$m(PC) - Program counter, offset</li>
<li>(reg) - Register, indirect</li>
<li>$m(reg) - Register, indirect, offset</li>
<li>(reg)+ Register, indirect, post-incremented</li>
<li>-(reg) REgister, indirect, pre-decremented</li>
<li>#m - Immediate</li>
</ul>
<p>Special "quick" instructions can use an immediate from 0-7, stored in the instruction word.</p>
<p>A CISC instruction set was chosen for maximum instruction density, as well as because it's what the mc68000 used.</p>
<p>Microinstructions are stored in a 2k word memory bank. 10 bit instruction opcodes act as a starting index, while an equally-wide NEXT field provides the next micro-address. Because microinstructions can jump to wherever, a significant amount of code can be reused.</p>
<p>Interrupts, faults, and reset requests also act as microinstruction indexes, and are appropriately selected based on current execution conditions.<br><br></p>
<p><strong>Assembler</strong></p>
<p><img alt="CPU-16 architecture flowchart" src="/projects/img/cpu16_asm.png" /></p>
<p>A quick-and-dirty assembler was written in Python, since only masochists like programming in machine code. It's a two-pass assembler; instructions are parsed first, and labels are filled in afterward.</p>
<p>Mnemonics and program structure are similar to that of a conventional mc68000 assembler.</p>
<p>Parameters are arranged in the order of "source,destination". Instructions are written as they appear on the info sheet.</p>
<p>Several directives are supported, including "dw" which defines a series of individual primitive data types and strings in memory.</p>            <br><br>
