<p><strong>Architecture</strong></p>
<p><img alt="IVANIAC architecture flowchart" src="/projects/img/ivaniac_arch.png" /></p>
<p>The IVANIAC is a Harvard architecture CPU, as it stores instructions in a separate instruction space from data. It lacks a dedicated data store, instead using two general-purpose registers. Both act as ALU operands, and can freely operate upon each other. It also features a display register, and a program counter</p>
<p>With a data width of 4 bits and no carry support, its numerical range is limited from 0 to 15. </p>
<p>The ALU can perform one of four functions on A and B— ADD, AND, OR, or XOR. Every operation sets the "overflow" flag, which is used by conditional jumps.<br><br></p>
<p><strong>Instruction set</strong><br />
In total, the IVANIAC has 16 bytes of 8-bit-wide program memory. The first half of each byte is an opcode, and the last half can be an immediate value or address depending on the instruction.</p>
<ol>
<li>00000000 - NOP</li>
<li>0001xxxx - MOV xxxx TO A</li>
<li>0010xxxx - MOV xxxx TO B</li>
<li>00110000 - MOV B TO A</li>
<li>01000000 - MOV A TO B</li>
<li>01010000 - ADD B TO A</li>
<li>01100000 - ADD A TO B</li>
<li>01110000 - AND B TO A</li>
<li>10000000 - XOR B TO A</li>
<li>10010000 - OR B TO A</li>
<li>10100000 - MOV INPUT TO A</li>
<li>10110000 - MOV INPUT TO B</li>
<li>11000000 - MOV A TO DISP</li>
<li>11010000 - MOV B TO DISP</li>
<li>1110xxxx - JMP TO xxxx</li>
<li>1111xxxx - JMP TO xxxx IF C != 1</li>
</ol>
<p>In the demo uploaded to YouTube, the IVANIAC was shown calculating fibonacci numbers. The program alternated between adding A and B to each other, moving them to the display register, and performing a conditional jump if there was an overflow.<br><br></p>
<p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p><img alt="IVANIAC flyover" src="/projects/img/ivaniac_flyover.png" /></p>
<p>In retrospect, the IVANIAC is a pretty poor design. Instruction decoding relies on slow repeaters, there's no arithmetic carry, no data memory, and address space is severely limited with 4 bits. However, I'm still proud of having built it.</p>
<p>I began working on the machine in late 2019, as a high school sophomore. I knew relatively little about computer engineering, but had nevertheless  wanted to build a redstone CPU. Far in over my head, the project quickly fizzled out. By the time April 2020 came around, I was stuck at home and had nothing better to do but finish the IVANIAC. After an entire week of building, it was finally completed.</p>
<p>It's amazing that the IVANIAC works at all, considering I didn't have any clear plans or schematics. I came up with everything as I went along, learning CPU design for the first time. Despite its inherent quirks, I'll always champion the IVANIAC as my first-ever architecture.</p>            <br><br>
